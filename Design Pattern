# Design pattern applied
<br>
This implementation was made by using Page Object Pattern, since allows me to manipulate the page elements without doing changes around the HTML.
There is a class with methods that manipulate the page data, and a test class where those methods are used.
<br>
Per each  group of elements that are going to be manipulated, a new object is created. This object can be used more than once by different procedures.
Per each "user action" that needs to be represented on the page, there is a test call to the proper method to do so.
